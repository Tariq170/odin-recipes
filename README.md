# Odin Recipes

This is my first project in The Odin Project's Foundations course. In this project, I am building a basic recipe website using only HTML.

## What Iâ€™ve Learned

By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated:
- How to structure a basic website using HTML
- How to use elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images
- How to organize content using semantic HTML
- How to create multiple pages and link them together

This project helps solidify my understanding of HTML fundamentals and prepares me for more complex web development tasks ahead.
